Using a survey of cities in California, this article examines a series of institutional remedies to low turnout in mayoral and city council elections. Moving local elections to coincide with the dates of national elections would have by far the largest impact on voter turnout, but other institutional changes that tend to raise the stakes of local elections also increase turnout. Specifically, less outsourcing of city services, the use of direct democracy, and more control in the hands of elected rather than appointed officials all tend to increase turnout.},

By contrast, institutional and campaign factors explain much of the variation. The effect of Progressive era reforms on depressing turnout is greatest in the most competitive elections. I conclude by discussing the implication of the overall downward trend in turnout and changes cities can make to increase participation.},

Our results show that, although institutional and sociospatial factors influence local turnout, the competitiveness of elections exercises the greatest influence on local electoral participation.

The authors provide such a characterization and test its implications with data on turnout in local legislative elections in 336 municipalities in 12 metropolitan areas. They examine the complex debate over the role of metropolitan political contexts in fostering political participation and identify four dimensions of contextual influence on turnout. They find that these contextual influences interact in significant ways that generate surprising results. Overall, however, the results lend far greater support to those favoring the consolidation of urban political institutions than those supporting further fragmentation of local government.},

Results show that voter turnout is dependent on the form of government. Political cities have the highest voter turnout, while administrative cities have the lowest voter turnout. By comparing structural differences between cities with different forms of government, the author determined that the direct election of the mayor, the expansion of mayoral executive authority, the separation of political power between the mayor and council, and/or the full-time status of the mayor and council are likely contributors to higher voter turnout in city elections.},

This literature has found that on-cycle elections lead to higher turnout, change the composition of the electorate, and could impact local governments’ policy outputs. But much of this work has focused on public schools. There has been little prior research on the impact of election timing on either elections or the broader political process in city and county governments. In this paper, we bring together a bevy of data sources on turnout in local elections, the outcomes of these elections, and local policy outputs. Overall, our results indicate there are significant participatory benefits to on-cycle local elections while few political consequences. Moving local elections on-cycle significantly increases overall voter turnout and the participation of younger and less wealthy voters. But it has negligible effects on the partisan composition of the electorate or the partisan and ideological outcomes of elections. Nor do on-cycle elections change the policy outputs of local governments. Our results help build a more holistic understanding of representation in local governments and the distinctive role of electoral institutions in facilitating representation.},

Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

	abstract = {Voter turnout has declined in elections at all levels of American government. Though much research has been devoted to understanding diminished turnout in national contests, there has been scant attention to factors affecting local electoral participation. In this study, we examine both cross-sectionally and longitudinally the impact on turnout of adopting a reformed plan of government and non-partisanship. Evidence from elections in the 1930s, 1960s, and 1970s suggests that council-manager government and nonpartisanship do, as hypothesized, impede municipal voter turnout.},

	abstract = {Most political scientists and historians find the home of reform government in the suburbs. The author shows that there was another style of reform government, big-city reform, in the big cities of the Southwest. The political system of big-city reform was distinguished by nonpartisan, city-manager government with citywide elections to the city council, low turnout and participation, and an electorate more Anglo and middle class than the metropolitan area as a whole. Big-city reform governments joined developer-dominated governing coalitions with Anglo middle—and upper-class communities in a growth community benefiting from good government.},

	abstract = {MatchIt implements several matching methods with a variety of options. Though the help pages for the individual methods describes each method and how they can be used, this vignette provides a broad overview of the available matching methods and their associated options. The choice of matching method depends on the goals of the analysis (e.g., the estimand, whether low bias or high precision is important) and the unique qualities of each dataset to be analyzed, so there is no single optimal choice for any given analysis. A benefit of nonparametric preprocessing through matching is that a number of matching methods can be tried and their quality assessed without consulting the outcome, reducing the possibility of capitalizing on chance while allowing for the benefits of an exploratory analysis in the design phase (Ho et al. 2007).},
